webgl.d.ts
==========

A WebGL definition file for TypeScript. Generated with help of my own IDL exporttool [idl2typings](https://github.com/RicoP/idl2typings).

Example App


	///<reference path="webgl.d.ts" />

	window.onload = () => { 
		var canvas = <HTMLCanvasElement> document.createElement("canvas"); 
		document.body.appendChild(canvas); 

		var gl = canvas.getContext("experimental-webgl", {}); 

		gl.clearColor(1,0,0,1);
		gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); 
	}


It's important to notice that the second parameter of getContext is mandatory so TypeScript can figure out that you want a WebGLContext and not a Canvas2DContext. 

This is a free library under the MIT license.

Credits go to Rico Possienka, I just added a few changes to make it work.
